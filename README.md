# Typeahead_javascript

# A typeahead with javascript front-end 


I was learning back-end and looking for something to hook up with the php,
as I knew javascript, I was trying to find something of it .

But instead I found jquery and for some reason I despise it ,
so I converted jquery to vanilla javascript .

everything else is old(I mean back-end)
